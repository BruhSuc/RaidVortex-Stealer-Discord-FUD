RaidVortex is an open-source C++ tool designed for Windows. It is created to discreetly collect Discord tokens from targeted systems and send them to your Discord server via webhooks.

- Purpose: This tool is intended solely for educational use to understand Discord's infrastructure and identify potential vulnerabilities. The project started about a year ago and has been updated recently.

# How It Works

- Operation: RaidVortex operates on Windows to extract Discord tokens. It searches through the file system to locate these tokens.

- Transmission: After finding a token, the tool sends a message containing the extracted token, host system details, and Discord account information to your Discord server using webhooks.

- Technology: Built with C++ 17, utilizing the filesystem module to search various directories. It can extract tokens from Discord and web browsers like Chrome, Opera, Brave, and Yandex.

- Token Extraction: The tool efficiently retrieves tokens and sends them to your Discord webhook.
